## About AKG Bensheim for iOS

"AKG Bensheim for iOS" is a project I started in spring 2012. It's an app for the students at my school here in Germany which helps them to keep track of their school week such as the substitution plan, upcoming appointments, their homework and which food is served in the canteen. It was actually my first bigger project as an app developer in cooperation with [P0T4T0x](https://github.com/P0T4T0x). It evolved quickly and is now running in its fourth major revision with far over 1K users worldwide.

Now, three years after the release of the first version, the complete AKG Bensheim for iOS project is available to everyone out there.

_A version for Android is available here: [AKG Bensheim for Android](https://github.com/P0T4T0x/AKGBensheim)_

## Change Log version 4.2.1 (from 4.2)

* First open-sourced version on GitHub
* Fixes a crash on devices where "24 hour format" is turned off

## Notes
**This project is associated with a german school called "AKG Bensheim" and has nothing to do with AKG Acoustics.**
